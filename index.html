								<p>I moved to San Ramon when I was a one year old from Chicago. I lived in a house on the north side of San Ramon until I was in eighth grade when we moved to south San Ramon right before high school started. Both houses provided me the opportunity to have easy access to San Ramon Golf Club, the place where my passion for golf started. I was able to go there every day and work on my game, and ultimately find the thing that I love doing. San Ramon also provided me with so many lifelong memories due to all of its landmarks and places to go.

                                <h4>Wilton, Connecticut <b>(Jonny)</b></h4>
								<p>My story in Wilton began in the First Grade when my dad moved me and my family to Connecticut for his work. I was an outsider and knew no one. Soon enough it felt like home. I played every sport I could, this began my love for hockey and up until recently lacrosse. I used to have my own ice rink in my yard that I would build with my dad on New Years Day and I would spend every possible day skating and practicing. It was my happy place. I have many of my fondest memories jumping my atv in the snow, going out on my homemade boat at the local pond, getting to play hockey during the halftime of the highschool rivalry game.</p>

                               <h4>Golf <b>(Jack)</b></h4>
								<p>When putting on the De La Salle golf uniform my freshman year, I felt nervous because I did not want to let my teammates down. Golf had always been an individual sport, but now I am not just playing for myself my whole mentality changed. While preparing for rounds I had to strategize differently than I would have in my individual tournaments. While wearing the DLS uniform we are taught to only make calculated risks, another way of saying do not mess it up for the team. In individual golf, you are the only decision maker, while in team golf knowing that one shot could determine a win or a loss for the team really changes your mentality. Putting on the DLS uniform taught me lessons I would have never learned and it prepared me for my near future in collegiate golf. </p>

                               <h4>Snapchat <b>(Jack)</b></h4>
								<p>The main platform of social media that I use is Snapchat. It provides me a way to connect with my friends, and also archive memories that I want to keep. There is a cool feature that if you save a photo on Snapchat, next year on that day it will say “Memory from one year ago” and you can see what you were doing that day. Seeing those bring back so many memories and reminds me of what I have done. Another reason I like it is that I can see what my close friends are doing. I would not say I am living vicariously through others because I am still living my life, but just also checking in on theirs. Whether we live in the past, present, or future is independent of each person. I personally tend to live in the future and I am always preparing for what is next, but Kairos taught me how to live in the present and I am working on living in the present at all times.</p>

                                <h4>Golf Team <b>(Jack)</b></h4>
								<p>The De La Salle golf team provided me with the widely advertised “brotherhood” that everyone talks about. As a freshman, I made the varsity team so I did not know any of the upperclassmen that I was going to be with for the next five months. They all were so accepting and took me under their wing and I learned so much about what the DLS brotherhood is all about. My sophomore year, there were no seniors on the team so it was just me, four juniors, and a freshman on varsity. We all became so close, and this bond carried us into my junior year where we had an extremely successful year on the golf course. This year since those four seniors left, I thought that the season would not be as fun since I lost most of my friends going to college. Although, this gave me the opportunity to get to know the younger guys on the team more and become the welcoming senior that I once had my freshman year. </p>

                                <h4>Jack</h4>
								<p>Before going on Kairos, I saw how it affected so many of my friends and turned their lives around, but I did not think that I needed any help. The first day, everyone was going really in-depth with their life, but I felt that I did not have any heartbreaking stories to share so I felt out of place. By cookie night, my whole retreat experience changed. I learned how loved I am by my peers and how I make an impact on other people’s lives. Kairos taught me a new definition of brotherhood that I had not felt from either the golf team or my friends at school. It taught me how speaking about your life, both the good and the bad is therapeutic not only to you but also the listeners. I learned so many different perspectives on life, and without Kairos would not be the more well-rounded person I am today. </p>

                                <h4>Norcal Championship Ring <b>(Jack)</b></h4>
								<p>My junior year, our golf team had an amazing season. We won EBAL, came in second in NCS, then we went to the NorCal championship in Lodi. We all started off poorly, but we all played well on the back nine. I was in the last group of the tournament, so all of my teammates had already finished their rounds by the time I was on the last hole, and it was extremely close. Before I started the hole, my coach told me that I had to make an eagle (really hard to make) on the hole and we would win the whole championship or a birdie to tie and go into a playoff. It was a par five, and after two shots I was just over the green, back by where over two hundred people were standing, watching us finish, including my teammates. If I chipped it into the hole, we would win. I was pretty nervous with everyone watching, but I hit the chip exactly how I wanted and it went in the hole! That feeling that I felt was like nothing I had ever felt before and my teammates all rushed over to me and congratulated me because we won. After that, we all got a ring to remember our fond memories of that year, and to celebrate being the #1 team in Northern California.</p>
